## Hi there 👋
I am an AI Engineer, bringing in AI into the manufacturing plant of Mercedes-Benz India Pvt. Ltd.
I thought I'd use Github to my advantage and showcase the different projects I am working on (obviously in a compliant way) along with the different questions and problems I solve.
The aim is to keep learning and improve 📈!
